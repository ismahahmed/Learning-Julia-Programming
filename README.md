# Learning Julia

GitHub repository for my semester long project in my CS-330 course: Structure and Organization of Programming Language. I will be learning how to program in the [Julia Language](https://julialang.org)

<a href="https://github.com/ismahahmed/Learning-Julia-Programming/blob/main/Assignment1/Background.md">Background</a> 
<p>Introduction to Julia Language including a background on where and when it was created. Includes links to several different resources when learning the     Julia programming language. This markdown file will also go through installation and running your first program.</p>
  
<a href="https://github.com/ismahahmed/Learning-Julia-Programming/blob/main/Assignment1/helloworld.jl">helloworld.jl</a>
<p>Example of Hello World in Julia. Also has example of different comments (single line/multi line comments)</p>

<a href="https://github.com/ismahahmed/Learning-Julia-Programming/blob/main/Assignment2/Data%20Types.md">Data Types.md</a> 
<p>Explanation and examples of data types and naming conventions in Julia. This file will aslo go through the *stylistic* conventions the julia community has developed. Introduces built in complex data types (examples: dictionaries, arrays, tuples)</p>
  
 <a href="https://github.com/ismahahmed/Learning-Julia-Programming/blob/main/Assignment2/data_types.jl">data_types.jl.md</a> 
  <p> Julia file on examples of: naming conventions, integers/integer variable types, strings/string variable types, floating point numbers, boolean, arrays, ditioonaries and simple math in Julia. </p>

<a href="https://github.com/ismahahmed/Learning-Julia-Programming/blob/main/Assignment3/Conditional%20Statements.md">Conditional Statements.md</a> 
<p>Explanation and examples of conditional statements in Julia language. This inclues: if/else if/else statments, boolean values, short circuit evaluation and switch case statements. This markdown file also includes resouces to learn more about conditional statements.</p>
  
 <a href="https://github.com/ismahahmed/Learning-Julia-Programming/blob/main/Assignment3/conditionals.jl">conditionals.jl.md</a> 
  <p> Julia file on syntax for conditional statements. I provide a few different examples on condional statements including one condition and multi conditional statements. Since Julia does not have a built in switch statement I include an exaple of how one can be implemented. </p>

<p>Explanation and examples of loops and functions in Julia language. This file goes through the following: for loops, while loops, syntax for declaring a function, lamda functions, mutating/non mutating functions, recursive functions and multi return parameters.</p>
  
 <a href="https://github.com/ismahahmed/Learning-Julia-Programming/blob/main/Assignment4/loops_and_functions.jl">loops_and_functions.jl.md</a> 
  <p> This Julia file will have examples on different loops in the Julia programming language as well as examples of functions and how to declare them! </p>

<a href="https://github.com/ismahahmed/Learning-Julia-Programming/blob/main/Assignment5/Structs.md">Structs.md</a> 
<p>This document will introduce Julia language structs. Structs (previously known as types) are similar to what other programming languages call classes. In short, structs are used for object oriented programming in Julia. There is a specific format used for Julia structs this is explained further in this markdown file.</p>
  
 <a href="https://github.com/ismahahmed/Learning-Julia-Programming/blob/main/Assignment5/structs.jl">structs.jl.md</a> 
  <p>This Julia file will have examples on structs. This includes syntax for creating structs and syntax to call a struct. It has examples of how objects are created.</p>
